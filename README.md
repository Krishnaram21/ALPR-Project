In this day and age, when there are more than 8 billion people on the planet and an equal 
amount of cars on the road, effective parking management has become essential. Vigilant gatekeeping is 
typically required in big residential areas because to the entry and egress of numerous vehicles, which can 
require significant labor and effort. In order to overcome these obstacles, the incorporation of Automatic 
License Plate Recognition (ANPR) is rather helpful.  
The approach that is being suggested entails creating an extensive database that holds car information for 
every member of a certain community. The Automatic Number Plate Recognition system, which has a camera 
placed strategically at the society's entrance gate, is smoothly linked to this database. The camera records a 
10- to 12-second video as a vehicle approaches. This footage is then processed into images at a 24-frame
per-second (fps) rate utilizing sophisticated technologies like Matlab, Python, and several AI algorithms and 
search strategies.  
During this procedure, the image of the vehicle is carefully examined, which results in the number plate 
being extracted. Next, a cross-reference is made between this retrieved number and the previous database. 
When a match occurs, the gate opens automatically, allowing the car to enter the community. In addition, 
the system has the capability to record the times of entry and departure for every car, adding an extra degree 
of protection and streamlining monitoring.  
By limiting access to authorized vehicles exclusively, the implementation of an ANPR based system not only 
improves overall security but also streamlines the parking management process. Security staff now have a 
much lighter duty because they only have to step in when a guest enters the society thanks to this innovation.
